            <p>Media has picked up on this story in the recent weeks and have brought this to public attention. India has had a few incidents of shaming victims of sexual assault. Media has been reporting that people are retweeting and sharing images of assault and mockingly creating hashtags. #IAmJada was used by people in support of the victim and against the abuse that she was receiving from the social media members. Most of the articles within the media discussed the spread of the images and the story and wrote against the attackers, but other articles wrote against the victim.</p>
