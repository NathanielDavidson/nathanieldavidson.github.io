            <p>Media has picked up on this story in the recent weeks and have brought this to public attention. India has had a few incidents of shaming victims of sexual assault. Media has been reporting that people are retweeting and sharing images of assault and mockingly creating hashtags. #IAmJada was used by people in support of the victim and against the abuse that she was receiving from the social media members. Most of the articles within the media discussed the spread of the images and the story and wrote against the attackers, but other articles wrote against the victim.</p>
            <p>In America our media has spoken very adamantly against actions that people take, generally taking sides on shaming incidents, be that for the person in the video being shamed or against them. In videos across the internet that show themselves confronting employees at target or other stores with regard to corporate policy. This divides America on the stance in favor or against the victim. In the instance of target, they would enter the target store and attempt to shame the store for a policy they have no control over. In this case it was bathroom policy. They would yell around the place talking about how it is against their religion for the bathrooms to be same sex. This was covered by the media and depending on the media outlet they would make fun of the people.</p>
