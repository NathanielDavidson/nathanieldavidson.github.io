            <p>Shame is used in order to create societal norms, the majority shames the minority into a unified mindset. And when the targets of societal corrections do not comply the harder the opposition to them becomes. This method of societal normalization has been defended by several people on the internet. As a way of bringing uniformity to society and limiting the conflicts with others morale code, shame is a tool that is used by the masses to conform the minority.</p>
            <p>As Cameron Harwick, a PhD candidate in economics from George Mason University, said that shame is necissary in order for people to live harmoniously together. In his words "It allows us to coexist smoothly in society with others, and impels us to self-improvement". This position is shared among others that explain that shame is a valid way of social cohesion. The digital shaming is an extension of this social function of social unity.</p>
            <p>News sites along with just everyday people conuct this social transformation of people through shaming every day. Each time that we point out what we see as stupid or abnormal we make fun of on the internet on twitter, facebook or other social media platforms.
