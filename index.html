            <p>Hello, my name is Nathaniel Davidson. I am currently a student in CST 373. I am a Computer Science Major with a concentration in Software Engineering. I am a transfer from Hartnell College. I am from Salinas and have lived their most of my life.</p>
            <p>I will be talking about media uploading and the abuse that goes on within them. Are they responsible at all for giving a platform to what otherwise would not be so easily passed around.</p>
            <p>Video file uploading and image sharing has become a large business. The business is now spreading to other aspects of society and regions around the world. Parts of the world that have very strict rules for women have come in conflict with these services. A more frequently occuring problem is called shaming. Uploading videos of rape in order to shame women. Live video of people committing suicide.  These problems have existed in the western world but prosecutorial laws are trying to keep up. In other parts of the world the victims are viewed as part of the problem so laws protecting them are difficult to pass. This has prompted a argument that the companies themselves should be the ones to protect the victims. Taking down videos or persuing legal action on behalf of the victims.</p>
