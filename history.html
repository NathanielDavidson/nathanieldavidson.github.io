            <p>History of shame within a social area has always been present. This is due to the necessity of social status. This creates a fear of a loss of social progress that someone has made. This can be used as a way to exploit someone and has been used enormously.</p>
            <p>The degree of what can tarnish or destroy someones social standing is dependent on several factors. Historically these factors were not as widespread and far reaching as they are today. The impact that social media and other internet platforms has been huge on this social mesh. The ability to destroy someones reputation has now become as easy as a click of a button.</p>
            <p>Historically this would be only reduced to a small area, around which the person is known. Now this dynamic has changed, and people around the world can get information that can destroy that persons reputation before even meeting the person. This preemptive destruction of social status has become massive due to social medias far reaching service boundary.</p>
            <p>Never before has a single post been viewable by so many. And in some parts of the world the law has been slow to catch up to protect the privacy and rights of the victoms.</p>
