            <p>Personally the idea that shaming is a thing is somewhat disgusting , but the act is what makes society the way it is.
            Without the ability to shame people we would be all over the place in terms of morality and ethics. But with the ability to shame and to feel shame
            we can make ourselves more likeable to others. This ability to adapt allows us to work together and not tear each other apart. This ability to unify society can be abused though
            and has been. The internet is a giant ocean of shame laced text for small things and big things. People shame others for their beliefs about movies. People shame people for the way that they dress. The excess
            level of shaming does the opposite of what it evolutionarily was developed to do. As people immigrated and became part of a greater group of people the need for conflicts
            to decrease became a need. Wars developed and eventually the vast differences in people caused countless deaths. Shame is a mechanism that counters that force. By feeling same we can modify
            ourselves to best work within the group as a whole. People who fail to fully integrate or go to far against society face the wrath of society.
            This does not mean that society does not change. As we modify the boundaries of what we consider the norm, and change our perceptions of behaviors we learn to adapt to a new level of normal. This change
            in society is often rejected by a minority group. This minority group may even be shamed into thinking the opposite and the minority group may feel oppressed and under attack. The act of shaming them does the very
            opposite. Instead of feeling like they should change they feel victimised. They feel they are the only right ones and that their idea or behavior should be the one accepted by the majority. This basic need to be the shaming party and not the shamed leads them to 
            drastic actions. There will always be groups like this fighting to become the norm or for certain actions to not be the norm. This is not unethical that they exist, in fact it allows for continued modification of what is considered normal.
            If we all had the same ideas about how things should be we would be in a dictatorship of ideas. Imagine if someone wanted to modify the way that society operated but it went counter to the way society is. Would that person be at risk if everyone wants to keep to a dictated by majority idea of normal.
            Fringe ideas are what help society grow. Shaming them will occur but if the idea is ethical and logical in nature then the idea can be accepted and any counter to the idea would then be shamed. Time, is the only thing that seperates
            normal ideas and behaviors. Ethics are not constant, and the idea of bad and good ethical grounds is an illusion of your current ethical basis. There are no morale absolutes, and there is no set rules on how people should behave.
            The only thing that truly exists is the shame that we feel when we do something that is contrary to what is ethical in our own books. Shame is a mechanism of change and a method of oppression. It is neither good nor bad. The removal or regulation of such
            a mechanism would violate the very nature of how society changes. we would become stagnant or constantly seperated.</p>
