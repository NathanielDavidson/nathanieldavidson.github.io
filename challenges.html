            <p>Internet shaming is growing and as more people are connected around the 
                  world, shaming that happened outside of the digital sphere now will move 
                  to the global internet field. Where shaming was done by either friends, family or 
                  your local community it will now include the internet community depending on the 
                  situation or idea expressed. The act of shaming as a corrective mechanism is both good and bad. 
                  Perhaps the majority holds a position that is opposite to an idea. Perhaps the majority should not 
                  be dictating to the minority as to how to act or behave, but this is a fantastical idea.</p>
            <p><b>5 Years</b></p>
            <p>As more people use create accounts on facebook, twitter, or other social media sites, 
                  the pool of sources of shaming will increase. As the opinions of the majority are 
                  applied online and fight against the opinions of others then the scale of shaming 
                  will be huge. As more shaming occurs then people will start to fight against public 
                  shaming. As more backlash occurs due to public shaming then people will be more 
                  cautious about shaming others on the internet. This will lead to counter shaming to 
                  the shaming of people due to behavior, ideas or atitudes. This can already be seen today. 
                  The counter to shaming helped in some way to elect Trump as the president. As people 
                  tried to shame Trump with his past actions it has backfired and instead partly motivated 
                  others to instead of accepting the idea or behavior as shamed has spurned the opposite reacton.</p>
            <p><b>10 Years</b></p>
            <p>In ten years I think that society will try and stop specific kinds of shaming. Shaming that is not useful towards the bettering
            of society would be viewed as counter to what we need to move forward. Shaming people for their ideas should be not allowed, an open debate regarding ideas
            should be accepted and welcomed. Debate is key when fighting an idea. If your idea is superior then prove it, do not feel as though you are entitled to have
                  your idea be accepted without question. I think that in <b>50 years</b> the same will be as it always was. People will continue to shame each other and the
            lack of shame will cause people to drift from each other in order to hide from the shame of others. This would divide us and would cause conflict. The entire point of shaming is to limit conflict and create a
            more unified society that can overcome the challenges of millions of different people from different walks of life from interacting with eachother on a daily basis. In the future more interactions with different cultures will become the norm, but we will need an
            understanding of each other in order to progress.</p>
